JavaScript developers have access to a wide range of browser APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow for 
various functionalities within web applications. These APIs enable developers to interact with the browser and the web page
 in numerous ways, from manipulating the DOM to accessing device hardware. Hereâ€™s a list of some common browser APIs 
 available to JavaScript developers, along with brief explanations:

1. DOM (Document Object Model) API
The DOM API provides methods and properties to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page. It allows developers to create, 
delete, and modify elements dynamically.

Key Features:

Access and modify HTML elements (getElementById, querySelector)
Change element attributes (setAttribute)
Modify element styles (style property)
Handle events (addEventListener)


2. Fetch API
The Fetch API provides an easy and modern way to make network requests, similar to XMLHttpRequest but with a more powerful and flexible syntax using Promises.

Key Features:

Make HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
Handle responses with Promises


3. Web Storage API
The Web Storage API allows developers to store data on the client side, in the browser. It includes localStorage for long-term storage and sessionStorage for temporary storage.

Key Features:

Store key-value pairs
Persist data across sessions (localStorage)
Store data for the duration of a session (sessionStorage)


4. Geolocation API
The Geolocation API provides access to the geographical location of the user, with the user's consent, allowing web applications to tailor experiences based on location.

Key Features:

Get current location (getCurrentPosition)
Track location changes (watchPosition)
