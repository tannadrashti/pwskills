The XMLHttpRequest object is an API provided by web browsers that enables JavaScript to make HTTP requests to servers. 
It can be used to request data from a URL without having to refresh the entire page, which helps in building more dynamic and interactive web applications.

How XMLHttpRequest is Used in AJAX
In AJAX, the XMLHttpRequest object is used to communicate with a server, typically in the following steps:


1. Create an Instance:

Create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object.

2. Initialize the Request:

Use the open method to specify the request type (GET, POST, etc.), the URL, 
and whether the request should be asynchronous (true or false).

3. Set up Callback Functions:

Assign functions to handle the response. The primary ones are onload for successful requests and onerror for 
network errors.

4. Send the Request:

Use the send method to send the request to the server.

5. Handle the Response:

Once the server responds, handle the data appropriately, typically by updating the webpage dynamically.
