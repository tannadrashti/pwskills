Purpose of localStorage and sessionStorage

localStorage:
Persistence: localStorage is designed to store data that persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. 
This makes it ideal for data that needs to be available across browser sessions.

Scope: Data stored in localStorage is shared across all tabs and windows of the same browser for the same domain.
Use Cases: Storing user preferences, settings, application state, or any other data that should remain available until 
explicitly deleted.

sessionStorage:

Persistence: sessionStorage is designed for data that needs to be stored temporarily and only for the duration of a page
session. Once the browser or tab is closed, the data is cleared.

Scope: Data stored in sessionStorage is specific to a single tab or window. It is not shared across different tabs or
windows.
Use Cases: Storing temporary data such as form data, progress, or any data that should only be available for the 
duration of a single browsing session.

Usage of localStorage:
Example 1: Storing User Preferences
Suppose you want to save the theme preference of a user (e.g., dark mode or light mode) and load it when they return to the site.

HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Theme Preference</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="setTheme('dark')">Dark Mode</button>
  <button onclick="setTheme('light')">Light Mode</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Usage of sessionStorage:
Example 1: Temporary Form Data Storage
Imagine a scenario where a user fills out a multi-step form, and you want to save the data temporarily to avoid data 
loss if they navigate away and come back to the form.

HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form id="userForm">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
    <button type="button" onclick="saveFormData()">Save</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="loadFormData()">Load</button>
  </form>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
