example, you can validate form inputs, create animations, or update content in real-time based on user
actions.

conditionals, enabling you to create complex logic and algorithms.

device, enabling real-time user interactions.

provide semantic meaning.

4. HTML's primary role is to define the content's structure and semantics, which browsers
render as a web page.
