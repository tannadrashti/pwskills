Grid:  CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns,
 making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. 
 Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.

To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid,
 set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, 
 and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.


 Flexbox: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout.
  It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). 
  It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.

To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: flex;

CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage. You can build complex as well responsive design with this.

 This is why it is called ‘layout first’.

Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.

CSS grids are for 2D layouts. It works with both rows and columns.

Flexbox works better in one dimension only (either rows OR columns).

It will be more time-saving and helpful if you use both at the same time.
