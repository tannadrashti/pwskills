Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to execute different actions based on different conditions. They allow your code to make decisions and perform different actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

There are three main types of conditional statements in JavaScript:

1. **if statement**: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

   ```javascript
   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if condition is true
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   if (x > 5) {
       console.log("x is greater than 5");
   }
   ```

2. **if...else statement**: It executes one block of code if the specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

   ```javascript
   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if condition is true
   } else {
       // code to be executed if condition is false
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```javascript
   let x = 3;
   if (x > 5) {
       console.log("x is greater than 5");
   } else {
       console.log("x is not greater than 5");
   }
   ```

3. **if...else if...else statement**: It allows you to specify multiple conditions to execute different blocks of code.

   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       // code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // code to be executed if condition2 is true
   } else {
       // code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   if (x > 15) {
       console.log("x is greater than 15");
   } else if (x > 5) {
       console.log("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15");
   } else {
       console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
   }
   ```

These conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of your JavaScript code and making it more dynamic and responsive to different situations.
