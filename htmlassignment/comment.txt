used to provide information about the structure, purpose, or notes about specific elements or sections of your HTML

    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

    <p>This is some content on the page.</p>

    <!--
    This is a
    multi-line
    comment
    -->

    <p>More content here.</p>
</body>
