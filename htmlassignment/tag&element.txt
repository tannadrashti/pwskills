Tag:

 A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (< and>) that specifies how a specific element on a web page should be
    formatted or behave.

    Tags are used to define the beginning and end of an element. They often come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing
    tag.

    Opening tags typically contain the element's name, while closing tags contain the same name with a forward slash (/)
    before it.

    Tags are not case-sensitive in HTML, but it's a best practice to write them in lowercase for consistency.
